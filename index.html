 <h3>Projects</h3>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Penetration Testing on windows operating system : </strong>Microsoft Windows is having a lot of
vulnerabilities to hack into system, we are going to check vulnerabilities in windows and if
found exploiting those vulnerabilities. If we don’t find vulnerabilities then we check how
installing software from unauthorized source on internet can cause harm to your system and
make your system vulnerable to hack.
</li>
<li><strong>Sunshine Weather App : </strong>A Fully featured Weather Forecast android application implemented with all the best practices like content providers, loaders, notifications, services,
  Shared Preferences, map intents, networking, View Recycling and many more.
</li>
<li><strong>Password Cracking with John the ripper on Linux : </strong><strong>John the ripper</strong> is one of the best and
easiest of the commands when it comes to password cracking on Linux. But there is still
delay in getting the cracked password which will depend on the type of password we have
chosen (weak or strong). It can take 2 mins or 5hrs or even 1 day that depends on the <strong>hash
value</strong> we got.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>To do list app : </strong>This intermediate-level project will show how to make a to-do list web app in JavaScript. We’ll be able to use this app to track whatever we want: cool programming tricks we want to learn, places to go, songs to listen to (or learn to play!),
   or just something as simple as things to pick up at the shops.
